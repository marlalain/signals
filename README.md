## Back-end structure

This project uses the [Microservice Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).

## Front-end and UI/UX

This project will try to get close to the Twitter UI/UX. The goal of the front-end is to be user-friendly and have as little migration friction as possible.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to have a full fullstack project -- with many of today's most talked-about technologies -- made open-source for my own learning and the learning of others.
